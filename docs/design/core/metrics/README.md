# SDK Tenets (unless you know better ones)

1. Collected metrics are easy to understand
2. Metrics can be compared overtime and gives insights into application behavior (provides value to customer)
3. Adding metrics should have minimal impact on the application performance
4. Customers can easily access published metrics
5. Verbosity of metrics should be kept to minimum in logs


# Project Introduction

This project introduces a feature that can collect and report SDK metrics data in your application.
These metrics can be used to gather insights into your application and tune the application for 
the best performance. The metrics can help in debugging when the application is experiencing
high error rates.
